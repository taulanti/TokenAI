# AI Access Protocol

**Making intelligence truly liquid, accessible, and composable**

Welcome to the AI Access Protocol documentation. This protocol transforms AI access from rigid subscriptions into programmable, transferable tokens that enable entirely new patterns of distribution, control, and exchange.
